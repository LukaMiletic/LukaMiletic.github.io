        <p>
          Meiosis is a type of cell division required for the process of
          sexual reproduction.It only occurs in <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sex--cells">sex cells</a> and not in <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/somatic-cell">somatic</a> cells.

          It consists of nine steps as opposed to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/cellular-molecular-biology/mitosis/a/phases-of-mitosis">mitosis</a> which consists of only four.

            <br><h3>Interphase 1</h3>
            <p>Interphase 1 is the first stage of mitosis and it consists of the mother cell duplicating its <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/dna">DNA</a>.</p>
            <p>-->This stage occurs both in meiosis and mitosis.</p>

                  <h3>Differences to Mitosis!</h3>

                  <p>Meiosis is in general fairly similar to mitosis but with a few key differences.</p>
                  <p>The most key difference is that meiosis results in 4 non identical daughter cells,</p>
                  <p>while mitosis results in two genetically identical daughter cells.</p>
